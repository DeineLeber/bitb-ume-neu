**automatic translation just for testing purposes**

The topics of Bits & Trees 2022 cover all topics at the interface of sustainability and digitalisation - and range, for example, from networked mobility to the raw material and power requirements of digital devices, data sufficiency and cooperative platform economies to smart energy networks or monopolisation tendencies in the digital economy. Lectures, workshops and panel discussions** await you. You can find the complete programme here: **LINK will follow after the programme has been created**.

In addition, you can look forward to many networking opportunities in the **Bits & Trees Forum**. Creative space for projects, organisations, networks and others, hacker space, living room, open stage, dance floor and much more.

**Pitch & Thrive for Sustainability ** "Shark Tank" in green aka "Die Höhle der Löwen", but in sustainable and without a camera. The future belongs to sustainable business models. During the conference, ideas are presented daily to a selected panel and the community. Afterwards, there will be valuable feedback and follow-up questions on the sustainability of the venture, but of course also on the potential profitability of the business case. An evaluation will be given by selected jurors and the audience.

Of course, a varied **cultural programme** is also provided. Music, readings and theatre. What more could you want? We are looking forward to a glorious opening event with "vollehalle" and an unforgettable closing party on Sunday evening.
